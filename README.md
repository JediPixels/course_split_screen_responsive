# Flutter Responsive Design with Split-Screen: for Mobile, Desktop, and Web
#### Flutter Split-Screen List and Detail Responsive Design for Phone, Tablet, Desktop, iOS, Android, macOS, Windows, Web


##    What are our objectives?

In this course, you'll use Flutter/Dart to develop a responsive app supporting a Split-Screen List/Detail layout from a single code base supporting multi-platform Phone, Tablet, Desktop, and Web.

For instance, you'll create the Split-Screen List/Detail on the same screen depending on device, and navigation from List to Detail page on phones.

Next, the Desktop and Web requires to handle both Mobile, Desktop, and Web responsive layout when user changes the size of the app’s screen.

Guess what? No third-party plugins or packages needed.

## What You'll Create

You’ll start by analyzing the app’s common features, reusable logic, and widgets.

You’ll implement Dark and Light Mode, global State Management, and Responsive Layout Builder widget.

The Phone app navigates from the List page to the Details page.

For the Tablet, Desktop, and Web app, you’ll create a Split-Screen layout showing the List and Detail pages on the same screen.
